# Introduction

POLAR represents a significant breakthrough in scalar-based reward models achieved through large-scale pre-training. It leverages the innovative **POL**icy Discrimin**A**tive Lea**R**ning (**POLAR**) paradigmâ€”â€”a scalable, high-level optimization objectiveâ€”â€”to effectively discriminate between policies using a large-scale synthetic corpora. Following pre-training, POLAR RMs are fine-tuned with minimal preference data, rapidly aligning with human preferences. Key features of POLAR include:

* **Innovative Pre-training Paradigm:**  POLAR trains a reward model to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between two policies, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships.

* **Tailored for Reinforcement Fine-tuning:** POLAR assigns rewards to LLM trajectories based on given references, perfectly aligning with the Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) framework. POLAR provides a promising solution for applying RFT in generic scenarios.

* **Superior Performance and Generalization:** POLAR achieves state-of-the-art results on downstream reinforcement learning tasks, consistently delivering accurate and reliable reward signals that generalize effectively to unseen scenarios and significantly reducing reward hacking.

* **Easy to Customize:** Pre-trained checkpoints of POLAR are available, enabling researchers to conveniently fine-tune the RM for various customized scenarios, thus facilitating straightforward adaptation and expansion tailored to specific applications and experimental requirements.

# Model Zoo

We release POLAR reward models in sizes of 1.8B and 7B parameters. The "base" models (POLAR-1.8B-Base and POLAR-7B-Base) refer to pre-trained-only checkpoints, ideal for customized fine-tuning according to specific preferences. The "ready-to-use" checkpoints (POLAR-1.8B and POLAR-7B) have been already fine-tuned on general preference data, making them suitable for immediate use in most scenarios.

# Performance

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of POLAR via the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We evaluate the downstream RL performances of four different policy models using [OpenCompass](https://github.com/internLM/OpenCompass/). More details are available in our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05197).

# Quick Start

## Installation

You could employ the latest [xtuner](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner) to fine-tune and use POLAR. Xtuner is an efficient, flexible and full-featured toolkit for fine-tuning LLMs.

- It is recommended to build a Python-3.10 virtual environment using conda

  ```bash
  conda create --name xtuner-env python=3.10 -y
  conda activate xtuner-env
  ```

- Install xtuner via pip

  ```shell
  pip install 'git+https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner.git@main#egg=xtuner[deepspeed]'
  ```

## Inference

We support reward inference through [lmdeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy/), [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/), and [vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/). We recommend setting up a virtual environment with conda when using these inference engines to prevent potential dependency conflicts.

### Data format

Unlike traditional reward models, POLAR requires an additional reference trajectory as a demonstration and evaluate candidate trajectories by measuring their consistency with the provided reference.

```python
data = [
    {
        "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
        "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
        "output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}]
    },
    {
        "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
        "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
        "output": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Shanghai."}]
    }
]
```

### Inference with transformers

#### Reward request
To load the POLAR model using transformers, use the following code to get rewards:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from xtuner.utils import RewardModelClient

model_name = 'internlm/POLAR-7B'

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    device_map="cuda", 
    trust_remote_code=True
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

client = RewardModelClient(model_name)
encoded_data = client.encode(data)
batch = tokenizer(encoded_data, return_tensors='pt', padding=True).to('cuda')
outputs = model(**batch)
rewards = outputs[0].squeeze(-1).cpu().tolist()
print(rewards)
```

### Inference with lmdeploy

[LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) is a toolkit for compressing, deploying, and serving LLMs.

#### Requirements

- lmdeploy >= 0.9.1

#### Server Launch

```bash
lmdeploy serve api_server internlm/POLAR-7B --backend pytorch --server-port 30000
```
#### Client Request

```python
from xtuner.utils import RewardModelClient

client = RewardModelClient("internlm/POLAR-7B",
                           server_type="lmdeploy",
                           server_address="127.0.0.1:30000")

# Request rewards directly
rewards = client(data)
print(rewards)

# First encode data and then get rewards via the request function.
encoded_data = client.encode(data)
rewards = client.lmdeploy_request_reward(encoded_data)
print(rewards)
```

### Inference with sglang

#### Requirements

- sglang >= 0.4.3.post4

#### Server Launch

```bash
python3 -m sglang.launch_server --model internlm/POLAR-7B --trust-remote-code --is-embedding --dp 4 --tp 2 --mem-fraction-static 0.9 --port 30000
```

#### Client Request

```python
from xtuner.utils import RewardModelClient

client = RewardModelClient("internlm/POLAR-7B",
                           server_type="sglang",
                           server_address="127.0.0.1:30000")

# Request rewards directly
rewards = client(data)
print(rewards)

# First encode data and then get rewards via the request function.
encoded_data = client.encode(data)
rewards = client.sglang_request_reward(encoded_data)
print(rewards)
```

### Inference with vllm

#### Requirements

- vllm >= 0.8.0

#### Server Launch

```bash
vllm serve internlm/POLAR-7B --task=reward --trust-remote-code --tensor-parallel-size=2 --port 30000
```

client = RewardModelClient("internlm/POLAR-7B",
                           server_type="vllm",
                           server_address="127.0.0.1:30000")

# Request rewards directly
rewards = client(data)
print(rewards)

# First encode data and then get rewards via the request function.
encoded_data = client.encode(data)
rewards = client.vllm_request_reward(encoded_data)
print(rewards)
```

## Fine-tune

### Requirements

- flash_attn
- tensorboard

### Data format

Unlike traditional reward models, POLAR requires an additional reference trajectory as a demonstration during fine-tuning, along with a chosen trajectory and a rejected trajectory. You can construct your fine-tuning data in a `train.jsonl` file, formatted as follows:

```json
{
    "prompt": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}],
    "reference": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
    "chosen": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Beijing."}],
    "rejected": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Shanghai."}]
}
```

### Training steps

- **Step 0:** Prepare the config. We provide examplar ready-to-use configs [here](./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py). If the provided configs cannot meet the requirements, please copy the provided config and do modification following the [xtuner guideline](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner/blob/main/docs/en/get_started/quickstart.md). For more details of reward model training settings, please see the xtuner [reward model guideline](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner/blob/main/docs/en/reward_model/modify_settings.md).

- **Step 1:** Start fine-tuning.

    ```shell
    xtuner train ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH}
    ```

  For example, you can start the fine-tuning of POLAR-7B-Base by

  ```shell
  # On a single GPU
  xtuner train ./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2

  # On multiple GPUs
  NPROC_PER_NODE=${GPU_NUM} xtuner train ./examples/xtuner_configs/POLAR_7B_full_varlenattn_custom_dataset.py --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2
  ```

  Here, `--deepspeed` means using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) to optimize the training. Xtuner comes with several integrated strategies including ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, and ZeRO-3. If you wish to disable this feature, simply remove this argument.

- **Step 2:** Convert the saved PTH model (if using DeepSpeed, it will be a directory) to Hugging Face model, by

  ```shell
  xtuner convert pth_to_hf ${CONFIG_FILE_PATH} ${PTH} ${SAVE_PATH}
  ```
